    <h3 align="center">E-commerce Backend</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this product is to improve upon a starter code to make a functioning e-commerce backend. This functioning system allows user to search via category, tags, and products, and allows them to create, update, and delete items. I built this project because as we move into a more digital world, it is something that helps customer shop online with ease. Additionally, it allows businesses to expand their experience and scope. This is a system that physical stores can use to help organize their inventory and organize the products they have on a database. This app is a solution for individuals who wants to easily access and modify information in their inventory. It allows them to stay organize and pull up information they need right away. Through this project, I learned how to develop my skills in Sequelize and further my understanding of Express.js.

## About the Project

This project is a e-commerce backend. The system is built with Javascript, Sequelize, MySQL WorkBench, ExpressJS, and nodeJS. To build and visualize the functionality and the localhost server, Insomnia was used. In this system, the main components are being able to: 

- View all categories, products, and tags (and its associations)
- View selected categories, products, and tags
- Add categories, products, and tags
- Update categories, products, and tags
- Delete categories, products, and tags

## Installation

To be able to use this application, you need to git clone this repository into your local machine. 

Afterward, you need to make an `.env` file with the following information :

```
DB_NAME = 'ecommerce_db'
DB_USER = YOUR USERNAME
DB_PW = YOUR PASSWORD
```

Afterward, you can use the commands in `schema.sql` to build your database on WorkBench. Once those are completed, you can install packages that are needed to work this program:

```
npm install -y
npm install sequelize
npm install mysql
npm install express
npm install dotenv
```

Once those are installed, you can go ahead and run this command to start the system

```
npm run seed
```

Once seeded, please go ahead and run this command:

```
npm run start
```

You should now be able to test out the functionality on Insomnia.

- Accessing `api/categories`
  - GET route will display all categories with it's associated product & tags
- Accessing `api/categories/:id`
  - GET route will display the specific category with it's associated product & tag for a category that is entered in place of `:id` 
  - PUT route will allow user to edit the specific category's name
  - DELETE route will allow user to delete the specific category
- Accessing `api/products`
  - GET route will display all products with it's associated categories and tags
- Accessing `api/products/:id`
  - GET route will display the specific product with it's associated category & tag
  - PUT route will allow user to edit the specific product's properties
  - DELETE route will allow user to delete the specific product
- Accessing `api/tags`
  - GET route will display all products with it's associated categories and products
- Accessing `api/tags/:id`
